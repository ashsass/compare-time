# compare-time
A project that I completed for my intermediate programming class. 

## purpose
- Take in two time intervals with a start time and an end time.
- When the user clicks the compare interval button, the GUI will tell determine if one interval is a subinterval of the other, if the intervals overlap, or if they are disjoint
- When the user inputs a time in the Time to Check Text Fied and then clicks the check time button, the GUI will determine if the time is in both intervals, just one interval, or in neither interval. 

## languages/frameworks:
- Java
- JavaFX

## topics covered
- Object oriented programming
- Generic classes
- Inheritance
- Conditionals
- JavaFX GUI building
